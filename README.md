The time difference between UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) and New York time varies depending on the time of year due to Daylight Saving Time (DST) adjustments. New York follows Eastern Time Zone (ET), which is either UTC-5 hours or UTC-4 hours during DST.

As a general guideline:

Standard Time (Fall/Winter):

The time difference between Eastern Standard Time (EST) and UTC is UTC-5 hours.
Daylight Saving Time (Spring/Summer):

The time difference between Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) and UTC is UTC-4 hours.
